### I designed my SDK so that it should be very readable. All endpoints can be found in `liblab/lotr_sdk/src/index.ts` and are grouped according to each endpoint found [here](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation). In the interest of readability, I have mirrored the endpoints but made them easier to access.

### API_URL and API_KEY changes can be made easily in one place, `liblab/lotr_sdk/src/constant.ts`

### Installing the SDK is simple and requires nothing more than an `npm install lotr_sdk`

### I've included a testing dir in this repo so you can install the sdk from npm and see how it is used, or test the repo locally. Simply `npm i lotr_sdk` or link the local repo, and run one of the test files, for example `node liblab/testing/book_test.ts`
